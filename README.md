#Healthcare Data Lakehouse & Analytics Platform

This repository hosts a scalable, end-to-end data lakehouse and analytics platform for healthcare, built on Databricks, PySpark, Delta Lake, and MLflow. The platform processes synthetic healthcare data (e.g., Synthea Parquet files) to enable advanced analytics, real-time monitoring, and predictive modeling. It addresses key healthcare use cases—patient journey tracking, disease surveillance, quality metrics, demographic analytics, and predictive pipelines—while ensuring compliance, performance, and extensibility.

##Architecture Overview

The platform follows a medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to transform raw healthcare data into actionable insights and machine learning-ready datasets:
- Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion (e.g., Synthea Parquet from dbfs:/mnt/raw/synthea/) with minimal transformation, preserving original structure.
- Silver Layer: Cleaned, normalized, and enriched data with schema enforcement and deduplication.
- Gold Layer: Aggregated, analytics-ready tables optimized for reporting, dashboards, and ML.
- Storage: Delta Lake ensures ACID compliance, schema evolution, and time travel for auditability.
- Processing: PySpark handles distributed ETL/ELT, streaming, and feature engineering.
- Orchestration: Databricks Workflows or Airflow automates pipeline execution.
- ML: MLflow manages experiment tracking, model training, and deployment.
- Analytics: Databricks SQL and Power BI deliver interactive dashboards.dashboards, and predictive modeling to track patient journeys, monitor disease trends, and improve healthcare quality metrics.
